# Integration Test Health Check Fix

## Problem Identified
Version service Docker health check mismatch between Dockerfile and docker-compose.integration.yml:
- **Dockerfile**: Uses Node.js-based health check with `node -e` command
- **Docker Compose**: Was using curl-based health check with `curl -f`

## Root Cause
Service starts correctly but health checks fail because:
1. Version service Dockerfile defines Node.js health check at line 28-29
2. Integration test compose file was using curl command 
3. Mismatch caused health check failures despite service running

## Solution Applied
Updated docker-compose.integration.yml line 34 to match Dockerfile health check:
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "node", "-e", "require('http').get('http://localhost:3006/health', (res) => process.exit(res.statusCode === 200 ? 0 : 1)).on('error', () => process.exit(1))"]
```

## Key Files Modified
- `/home/rgoldberg/projects/figure-collector-services/docker-compose.integration.yml` - Updated version-manager-test health check

## Integration Test Framework Status
- All services configured with test ports (+5 from production)
- MongoDB test container configured with proper authentication
- Health check alignment across all services
- Ready for validation testing
